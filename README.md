# ZoukCity - Web
Hello! This is a vanilla HTML & CSS website that I started a while back while trying to learn some web design basics. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing, as my career trajectory stayed within the backend development track, but I'm planning to start some revamping summer 2024 while I look for my next role! Stay tuned.
