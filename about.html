<h1 class="index_h1">About BZouk City</h1>

<h2 class="index_h2">About the Site</h2>
<p>
    BZouk City is a web development project for the purpose of connecting the
    Brazilian Zouk local communities. We at BZC want to provide community
    members, students, organizers, teachers, DJs, and all other participants in
    the dance community with resources to connect with one another to make
    classes, socials, and all events more successful through connection and
    information.
</p>

<h2 class="index_h2">About the Developer</h2>
<p>
    BZouk City is a personal full stack software development project of a
    Brazilian Zouk dancer local to Austin, TX. This project is intended both for
    learning purposes and to provide a resource to the local community. In early
    development, this website will only contain information for events in
    Austin, but over time, the developer's goal is to expand the website's
    functionality so that users can filter by their area.
